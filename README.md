# Capstone2_project : Electric Load Forecasting

Electric load forecasting is the prediction of electrical power required to meet the short term, medium term or long term demand. The forecasting helps the utility companies in their operation and management of the supply to their customers. So, it is very important for utility companies to have a reliable and accurate load forecasting models to allocate appropriate resources to meet the demand from consumers.

Recently Texas have seen wide spread power outages as a result of extreme weather conditions (severe freezing as well as hot summer days). During such events, the utility companies have asked residents to limit their electric usage to avoid outage. A model that forecasts energy demand accurately would be very helpful to avoid wide spread power outage instead of waiting for consumers to limit their usage. The main objective of this project would be to build a robust model that predict hourly electric load in each weather zone in Texas (see image below) in the short term (the next 7 days).

The project will be sub-divided into several notebooks as follows:

    Data Wrangling
    Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
    Pre-processing and Training and
    Modeling
